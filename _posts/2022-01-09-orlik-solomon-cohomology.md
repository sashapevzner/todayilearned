In the study of configuration spaces, a seminal result
of Vladimir Arnold computed the group cohomology of the
braid group.
Arnold's original proof relied on the interpretation of
the space $$M_n$$ of 
and a stratification 
\\[ \cdots \subset M_{n-1} \subset M_n \subset M_{n+1} \subset \cdots \\]
together with a spectral sequence calculation.

In the article ["Orlik-Solomon algebras in algebra and topology"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1070/RM2001v056n02ABEH000383)
Yuzvinsky gives an alternate proof of the more general statement
that the Orlik-Solomon algebra of a hyperplane arrangement is the
cohomology ring of its complement.
This post is meant to be a guide to the proof, including all required background.
